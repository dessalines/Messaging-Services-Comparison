# Messaging Services Comparison

This is a backup of a [google drive based comparison of messaging services and communications protocols](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-UlA4-tslROBDS9IqHalWVztqZo7uxlCeKPQ-8uoFOU/edit#gid=0), but you know, not actually hosted on a centralized service.

This will be updated with new services as they come out.
